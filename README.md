# CasinoProject
Casino Java Application

This project aims to create a Casino application wherein a user can ener and choose to play one of the three games namely:
1.  Poker
2.  BlackJack
3.  Slots

This is a client server application and hence will require the person who wishes to execute it to run the server.java file first.
Once connected, client.java must be executed next.
For those of you who wish to execute this via the command prompt, the following commands will work.
NOTE: Make sure your system has the latest Java version installed and the environment variable are also set.
1. Navigate to the folder where this project is stored. Use cd to change the path. Eg: cd \Desktop 
2. Navigate to src folder inside this project
3. Type javac Server.java to compile Server class
4. Type javac Client.java to compile Client class
5. Type java Server to run the Server. You should see the following message
    Server Started...
6. Open another command prompt screen and navigate inside src folder and then type java Client to run client program.
7. This will start the program
